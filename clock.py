# Project #9, ASCII Clock

# A project to display times using a classical seven-segment display of given 
# times input in a 24 hour format.

# The variable tm should be a string in the form of time on a 24 hour clock. 
# For example 01:17, 10:39, 20:41

# Note we assume the input 24-hour time strings are in the correct format.

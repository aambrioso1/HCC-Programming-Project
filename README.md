A description of some of the programs in repository

noaa_json.py:  This program shows how to retrieve JSON data from stations tracked by the NOAA in water ports throughout the USA. 

plot.py:  A module that creates a line graph given two lists of numbers.

MadLib.py:   Demonstrates how to use interploted f-strings by generated random responses for a MadLib.

comprehension.py: This is a lesson in comprehension.   Comprehension is a nice way to build lists, sets, and dictionaries.

CountNeighbors:  Sketch of a program to count x's, o's, and blanks on a tic-tac-toe board.

monte_carlo_pi.py:  Uses a Monte Carlo technique to estimate Pi.   Displays a nice plot using the matplotlib 
library to illustrate the idea.

counting_colorings.py:   Counts the number of colorings possible if n walls are colored with n colors.  Also partitions the set of all colors by the number of colors used.  Uses itertools product function to comtrol the number of nested for loops.  The itertools library contains functions for creating iterators for efficient looping.

f_string_lesson:  This lesson has is about manipulating strings, lists, and reading and writing to files.

function_lesson:  A lesson on functions in Python.

monte_carlo_pi:  A visual demo of Monte Carlo technique for calculating Pi.

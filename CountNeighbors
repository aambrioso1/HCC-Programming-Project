#  Lesson for Friday May 17th:   Counting Neighbors on a Generalized Tictactoe Board

#  Consider a n x n board consisting of squares that are with an x, an o, or a blank.  
#  Create a function that counts the number of squares around the chosen square that are marked x, o, or blank.
#  We adopt a data structure involving a matrix of integers and a system of keeping track of the squares.

#  We will begin by having everyone write down an algorithm using plain language on paper.
#  Bring some paper and a pencil or pen!!!
#  We will discuss these algorithms and how to implement them in Python.
#  We will write the code for the algorithm and test it on a few boards.
#  If there is time will be try reading example boards and square numbers from a file and writing the results to a file.

#  Here is a sketch of the function definition will need to write.
  
#  def CountNeighbors(board, square):
      # Some code here ...
      # ...
      #return [c1, c2, c3]
      
# Here is an question:  What should c1 + c2 + c3 equal?

# We will choose a board and square to try out our program.
# bd = ExampleBoard
# sq = ExampleSquare

# We use our function to count neighbors
# NeighborList = CountNeighbors(bd, sq)

# We output th result.
# print(The number of o's, x's, and empty squares respectively is %i, %i, %i' % (NeighborList[0], NeighborList[1],NeighborList[2]))
